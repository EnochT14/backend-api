# Test with Postman or HTTPie
Run backend api with "npm start", open postman and put in your query URL ie. "http://localhost:3001/api/stock/stock-search", then add header "Content-Type" w/ value "application/json" and "Authorization" w/ value "Bearer token". To find your bearer token run the frontend and signup/signin w/ your account. Open your browsers dev tools then go to the network tab. Refresh your homepage and look for requests with {;} as the icon, open the headers section under the "Request Headers" section you would find "Authorization", copy the entire content in the Authorization tab and use that in postman.
